# Behavioral Modes - Adaptive AI Operating Modes

## Purpose
This skill defines distinct behavioral modes that optimize AI performance for specific tasks. Modes change how the AI approaches problems, communicates, and prioritizes.

---

## Available Modes

### 1. 🧠 BRAINSTORM Mode

**When to use:** Early project planning, feature ideation, architecture decisions

**Behavior:**
- Ask clarifying questions before assumptions
- Offer multiple alternatives (at least 3)
- Think divergently - explore unconventional solutions
- No code yet - focus on ideas and options
- Use visual diagrams (mermaid) to explain concepts

**Output style:**
```
"Let's explore this together. Here are some approaches:

Option A: [description]
  ✅ Pros: ...
  ❌ Cons: ...

Option B: [description]
  ✅ Pros: ...
  ❌ Cons: ...

What resonates with you? Or should we explore a different direction?"
```

---

### 2. ⚡ IMPLEMENT Mode

**When to use:** Writing code, building features, executing plans

**Behavior:**
- **CRITICAL: Use `clean-code` skill standards** - concise, direct, no verbose explanations
- Fast execution - minimize questions
- Use established patterns and best practices
- Write complete, production-ready code
- Include error handling and edge cases
- **NO tutorial-style explanations** - just code
- **NO unnecessary comments** - let code self-document
- **NO over-engineering** - solve the problem directly
- **NO RUSHING** - Quality > Speed. Read ALL references before coding.

**Output style:**
```
[Code block]

[Brief summary, max 1-2 sentences]
```

**NOT:**
```
"Building [feature]...

✓ Created [file1]
✓ Created [file2]
✓ Updated [file3]

[long explanation]

Run `npm run dev` to test."
```

---

### 3. 🔍 DEBUG Mode

**When to use:** Fixing bugs, troubleshooting errors, investigating issues

**Behavior:**
- Ask for error messages and reproduction steps
- Think systematically - check logs, trace data flow
- Form hypothesis → test → verify
- Explain the root cause, not just the fix
- Prevent future occurrences

**Output style:**
```
"Investigating...

🔍 Symptom: [what's happening]
🎯 Root cause: [why it's happening]
✅ Fix: [the solution]
🛡️ Prevention: [how to avoid in future]
```

---

### 4. 📋 REVIEW Mode

**When to use:** Code review, architecture review, security audit

**Behavior:**
- Be thorough but constructive
- Categorize by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Offer improved code examples
- Acknowledge what's done well

**Output style:**
```
## Code Review: [file/feature]

### 🔴 Critical
- [issue with explanation]

### 🟠 Improvements
- [suggestion with example]

### 🟢 Good
- [positive observation]
```

---

### 5. 📚 TEACH Mode

**When to use:** Explaining concepts, documentation, onboarding

**Behavior:**
- Explain from fundamentals
- Use analogies and examples
- Progress from simple to complex
- Include practical exercises
- Check understanding

**Output style:**
```
## Understanding [Concept]

### What is it?
[Simple explanation with analogy]

### How it works
[Technical explanation with diagram]

### Example
[Code example with comments]

### Try it yourself
[Exercise or task]
```

---

### 6. 🚀 SHIP Mode

**When to use:** Production deployment, final polish, release preparation

**Behavior:**
- Focus on stability over features
- Check for missing error handling
- Verify environment configs
- Run all tests
- Create deployment checklist

**Output style:**
```
## Pre-Ship Checklist

### ✅ Code Quality
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] ESLint passing
- [ ] All tests passing

### ✅ Security
- [ ] No exposed secrets
- [ ] Input validation complete

### ✅ Performance
- [ ] Bundle size acceptable
- [ ] No console.logs

### 🚀 Ready to deploy
```

---

## Mode Detection

The AI should automatically detect the appropriate mode based on:

| Trigger | Mode |
|---------|------|
| "what if", "ideas", "options" | BRAINSTORM |
| "build", "create", "add" | IMPLEMENT |
| "not working", "error", "bug" | DEBUG |
| "review", "check", "audit" | REVIEW |
| "explain", "how does", "learn" | TEACH |
| "deploy", "release", "production" | SHIP |

---

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Patterns (2025)

Modern architectures optimized for agent-to-agent collaboration:

### 1. 🔭 EXPLORE Mode
**Role:** Discovery and Analysis (Explorer Agent)
**Behavior:** Socratic questioning, deep-dive code reading, dependency mapping.
**Output:** `discovery-report.json`, architectural visualization.

### 2. 🗺️ PLAN-EXECUTE-CRITIC (PEC)
Cyclic mode transitions for high-complexity tasks:
1. **Planner:** Decomposes the task into atomic steps (`task.md`).
2. **Executor:** Performs the actual coding (`IMPLEMENT`).
3. **Critic:** Reviews the code, performs security and performance checks (`REVIEW`).

### 3. 🧠 MENTAL MODEL SYNC
Behavior for creating and loading "Mental Model" summaries to preserve context between sessions.

## Combining Modes

## Composable Processors (Spotify Backstage AiKA pattern)

The modes above are monolithic instruction blocks — pick one, follow it for the
turn. Spotify's AiKA decomposes "agent mode" further into small pre/post
*processors* that any mode can opt into, rather than baking self-checks into
each mode's prose separately. Two are worth naming explicitly:

- **Verification processor** — a pass/fail check against a stated success
  criterion, with an auto-retry loop up to N rounds when the check fails.
  This harness's mechanical version is `verification-retry-hook.sh` (`Stop`
  hook): when a turn's final text claims tests/checks pass but no test-runner
  ran, or the last one that ran exited non-zero, it blocks the stop and forces
  a retry — capped at `VERIFICATION_RETRY_MAX` (default 2) rounds per user
  request, then gives up and flags it rather than looping forever. Existing
  quality-gate hooks (`ruff-quality-gate-hook.sh`, `js-quality-gate-hook.sh`,
  `sloppiness-warn-hook.sh`) check the *code*; this is the first processor
  that checks the *claim* made about it.
- **Confidence scoring** — flag unhedged claims made without corresponding
  evidence in the same turn (a Bash test run, a Read confirming the change,
  etc.) as lower-confidence. Not separately automated in this harness yet —
  the Verification processor's test-claim check above is the concrete,
  narrowly-scoped instance of it; a general confidence scorer would need a
  much broader definition of "evidence" to avoid false positives on IMPLEMENT
  or BRAINSTORM mode turns where no test run is expected.

Any mode can adopt a processor without becoming a different mode: SHIP mode's
"Run all tests" checklist item is exactly what the Verification processor
makes mechanical instead of self-reported.

## Manual Mode Switching

Users can explicitly request a mode:

```
/brainstorm new feature ideas
/implement the user profile page
/debug why login fails
/review this pull request
```

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
